# Westworld Character Quiz
I created this quiz for an HTML/CSS/JavaScript Project in my BYU CS 260 Web Programming Class. We were given the liberty to design whatever kind of webpage we wanted. I've been watching the HBO show Westworld lately and decided to do a personality-based character quiz. I used this guide (https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/) to help me build my quiz, but made major modifications in order to make each question conditionally contribute to a person's character score and return the character the user is most similar to.

I used the Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks/libraries to assist in my development of this website.
